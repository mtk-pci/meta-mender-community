==========================

Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded Linux devices. Mender comprises a client running at the embedded device, as well as a server that manages deployments across many devices.

This repository contains Yocto recipes for community supported Update Modules. An Update Module is an extension to the Mender client for supporting a new type of software update, such as a package manager, container, bootloader or even updates of nearby microcontrollers. An Update Module can be tailored to a specific device or environment (e.g. update a proprietary bootloader), or be more general-purpose (e.g. install a set of .deb packages.).

There are a couple of general-purpose Update Modules bundled together with the [Mender client source code](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/tree/master/support/modules), these can be installed using [meta-mender](https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender).
