I. Adding the meta-mender-qemu-client-only layer to your build
=================================================

Run 'bitbake-layers add-layer meta-mender-client-only'

II. Misc
========

This layer enables the Mender client to be installed and operated without the full integration. With the layer added to the build, you can add `mender-client` and optionally `mender-connect` to the `IMAGE_INSTALL` variable and have those installed. The `MACHINE` will be used as device type.

With client and connect installed, you can use all Update Modules and the Troubleshoot AddOn. Installing a root filesystem update is not supported.
